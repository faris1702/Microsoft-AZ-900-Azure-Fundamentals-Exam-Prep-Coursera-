# Microsoft-AZ-900-Azure-Fundamentals-Exam-Prep-Coursera
Completed this course that prepares students on taking the AZ-900 course. It covers the basic of Cloud Computing and what services are provided by Azure. However, I feel like this course is quite unstructured everything is all over the place. I recommend going to other sources.
